                    <h2>RECAP: PANEL INSIGHTS: VENTURE TRENDS & 2025 OUTLOOK</h2>
                    
                    <p>Hunter Nadler, who leads JP Morgan's startup banking business on the East Coast, and Sale Kwan, a partner at the emerging companies and venture capital group of Cooley LLP based in Palo Alto, shared their insights at a panel moderated by our co-president Sheila Proeve in January 2025. Key insights included:</p>

                    <h3>Outlook for startups</h3>
                    <p>Sale said the VC industry seems to have stabilized and there are signs of an uptick in round size and valuation. The elephant in the room is AI, with outlier deals driving deal volume. Hunter said median seed stage post-money valuations are at an all-time high, with the top quartile seed companies increasing 65% year over year. However, there are more down rounds for seed companies going for series A.</p>

                    <h3>Cadence of VC investment in 2025</h3>
                    <p>There is muted seasonality, and VCs are looking at the longer term. The median time between financings is getting longer, at 25 months. Also, companies are staying private longer. Many companies are looking to raise capital.</p>

                    <h3>When early-stage founders should think about raising this year</h3>
                    <p>The principle is to raise the minimum that can get you to the next inflection point. If you raise more, you're getting over-diluted. Key factors for early-stage founders are whether they are raising capital to solve a problem or to scale a solution. Also, invest in relationships.</p>

                    <h3>Key industries poised for explosive growth</h3>
                    <p>Applied tech and commercializing groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs in sectors such as defense, space tech, robotics, and semiconductors. The tech supply chain is going to drive innovation. AI powered agents.</p>

                    <h3>Legal developments affecting startups and venture capital</h3>
                    <p>The Corporate Transparency Act, currently suspended, requires certain companies to report beneficial ownership. OISP, the Outbound Investment Security Program, which will apply to investment transactions by a US person into a company that has some nexus to China, includes semiconductors, quantum technologies and AI. Another is the use of AI in employment and hiring, as states such as New York put out laws that regulate the use of AI in that area.</p>

                    <h3>Venture, debt, cash management - optimizing the runway</h3>
                    <p>Think timing, holding periods, wealth strategies, and pre-transaction planning for the company and for individuals. Next is looking at the means of financing, via debt, receivables or equity. Look at equity as the most efficient way to deploy flexible cash. Equity is not good to buy equipment. Specific capital can be cheaper and non-dilutive. Start-ups requiring big equipment could raise equity to buy it and be diluted, or banks are willing to lend against the equipment.</p>

                    <h3>Advice for angel investors and LPs</h3>
                    <p>Follow friends and people you trust. High quality investors usually have overlap with portfolio companies and industries. For angels, it is patience - for these companies to turn around is going to take a long time. For angels, do stuff you love and invest in companies you really love.</p>

                    <h3>Capital going into robotics</h3>
                    <p>There will be interest by both government and opportunistic investors. Traditionally, venture funds have a 10-year life. They put their capital in in the first 2-3 years and want exits to happen within 10 years, so they don't want capital intensive businesses.</p>

                    <h3>Advice for founders and angels</h3>
                    <p>Hunter said to think about professional and personal technology, business and financial platforms, the community as a platform, and platform impact and scalability. Sale said that although he often sees people trying to solve a business problem with legal solutions, legal is often an expensive and ineffective way to solve a problem so founders should focus on communication, relationships and common sense.</p>

                    <h2>RECAP: FEBRUARY PITCH</h2>
                    
                    <p>Five excellent start-ups pitched at the SAEU Pitch Day event on 5 February. Short summaries of the companies are below, and more information is available for potential angel investors.</p>

                    <h3>ANI. ML Health</h3>
                    <p>ANI. ML Health is using AI solutions to improve veterinary health care. A typical veterinary doctor spends 20-60 minutes to review the medical history and records of each patient, and 20-60 minutes to write the medical record after the visit. ANI. ML provides specific platforms, tailored to the veterinary medical space, that summarize medical records that it says are accurate, reliable, useful and improve veterinary doctors' productivity significantly.</p>

                    <h3>MRGN</h3>

                    <h3>Misogi Labs</h3>
                    <p>Misogi Labs empowers pharma to reduce the time and cost of developing small molecule drugs by replacing trial and error experiments with AI optimization. Today, less than 5% of drugs make it to the final patients, due to the poor ability of drugs to cross biological barriers.</p>

                    <h3>Melurna</h3>
                    <p>Melurna focuses on eliminating companies' third-party data leaks.
