                    <h3>Chronica</h3>
                    <p>Chronica describes itself as a next generation, remote patient management company. Remote patient management delivers real time engagement and monitoring of patients remotely at home. These services cut costs and improve health outcomes, benefit public and private insurers, and incentivize physicians to offer these services to patients and to pay for them. It offers a trio of success - high margins, patient satisfaction and client staff happiness - which it says generates value for its customers, which are physician practices.</p>

                    <h3>Halo Science</h3>
                    <p>Halo is an AI-powered R&D partnering platform that supports the $2.5 trillion that is spent on R&D annually. Instead of relying exclusively on their internal teams to do research and find new technologies and make advancements, companies are looking to academic researchers, startups and other companies. Halo is helping companies find partners more efficiently so they can bring new innovations to market faster. It says 16,000 researchers and science-led startups across 150 countries have joined the network organically.</p>

                    <h3>Resonant Health</h3>
                    <p>Resonant is building an AI-native practice-in-a-box for doctors. Providers are overwhelmed with administrative work, documentation and fragmented software that is built around billing, not actually healing. Resonant offers full scope workflow automation in a box, so it can integrate with labs, pharmacies and payers, and help doctors set them up. Healthcare providers like having one place where they can do everything, so they can focus on the patient and still optimize billing, which makes primary care sustainable.</p>

                    <h3>ChemT Biotech</h3>
                    <p>ChemT boosts cell yield in biologics manufacturing. So far, most researchers have used a trial-and-error process to unlock cells potential. ChemT is addressing this problem by developing specific treatment for cells, identifying what targets on the cells are regulating a particular functionality, and developing small molecules for that functionality. ChemT says its drug discovery platform is faster in developing products and makes it easier to commercialize.</p>

                    <h3>Investing in Sustainability Startups</h3>
                    
                    <p>SAEU kicked off our sector-specific investor series and hosted a panel discussion <em>Investing in Sustainability Startups</em> on March 26 with Amy Francetic, AB '89, Founding Partner of Buoyant Ventures, and Dan Matthies, Partner at Reaction Global. This is a summary of the discussion moderated by Co-president Richard Hartung, MBA '86.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Given the current geopolitical situation, what do you see happening in climate and climate tech investing over the next three or four years?</em></strong><br>
                    Amy said it's certainly a rough time. Folks are nervous, and from a climate standpoint, they are watching what is happening at the federal level and worrying about pullback from investors and other headwinds. She thinks there are a lot of opportunities in Europe because there are some better rules and regulations, though they're not immune to the volatility in the US.<br>
                    Dan mentioned a book written in 1907 called the <u>Pitfalls of Market Speculation</u>. Data suggested that when the market is high, people do 90% of their buying at the top. When the market goes down, they do 90% of their selling at the bottom. On the geopolitical side, manufacturing is very capital intensive and has an unpredictable outcome. Those business models are going to be very tough. He is looking for companies that make customers more profitable and marketable, and that can weather the storm. This is a good time to buy.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>What key themes or trends would you look at as investors?</em></strong><br>
                    Dan said AI is an area that people are focused on. Another trend is where insurance companies use AI and sources such as drones to calculate risk in a different way.<br>
                    Amy said her fund is particularly interested in digital, with businesses delivering core business value to improve profitability, reduce cost, improve yield or productivity, simplify things, and automate things. We've described that as vertical AI.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Are there sectors that are particularly attractive or unattractive?</em></strong><br>
                    Amy said one area they're excited about is green computing, which is trying to make computing less energy intensive. There's going to be a lot of appetite from big tech companies, data center builders and managers, and in general, as more companies move to AI. An area we're bearish on is carbon markets.<br>
                    Dan said they avoid plant-based foods. On the other hand, innovative companies such as Galy, which grows cotton in a lab 10 times faster with a fraction of the water, are attractive.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Angel and some VC investing has slowed. Do you see investments picking up again and funding becoming more available?</em></strong><br>
                    Dan said he is seeing a slowdown in capital availability, partly because of human sentiment. When a market goes down, you want to wait and get your money out. When M&A drives up, you're holding on. It's a great time to invest because the market is rationalized.<br>
                    Amy said that in 2024, about $30 billion was deployed into the climate space, a slight decline of about 14% compared to 2023. However, there was a dramatic decline in growth stage investing. Funds are raising more later stage venture funding, but they're not deploying it. We see it in Series A. It's hard to find follow-on investors. A Series A company four years ago would have had about a million dollars of revenue. Nowadays, you have to have $2 million. Its a good time to find deals. You're seeing a lot of bridge rounds now.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>One thing angels look at is how to help a company informally or formally. What do startups actually need?</em></strong><br>
                    Amy said investors with all backgrounds can support the companies. The biggest thing is technology. Then, they need salespeople who will make commercial introductions. A number of startups have created advisory boards to get insights from folks outside the company.<br>
                    Dan said Reaction has a network of networks that is all individual Reaction investors. We are leaders all throughout different markets and industries. It's a great group to pair up with the companies.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>If someone is advising a startup, how are they compensated?</em></strong><br>
                    Amy said it varies. Usually, they get a small option grant. Companies don't normally have cash. They probably would pay expenses, but not a consulting fee. An equity grant might be half a percent.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>How are startups positioning themselves in response to requests to take the word sustainability from projects?</em></strong><br>
                    Amy said energy security is a big replacement phrase, or energy transition. Anything around cost savings or efficiency is being talked about. People are also using the term American energy dominance. People are definitely changing their language to try to be more appealing.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>What solutions have you seen to make data centers more sustainable?</em></strong><br>
                    Dan said the data centers that you see today look nothing like they'll be in 10 years, because of this wave of AI and a wave of quantum following AI. The speed of computation and transmission will need to be light speed and have completely different hardware.<br>
                    Amy said folks are trying to power the data centers with clean energy. They're doing Bring your own Power, to bring clean power to the data centers themselves, in addition to the grid interconnection. On the software side, they're creating code that runs much more efficiently.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>How do you measure the sustainability impact of a startup?</em></strong><br>
                    Amy said they discuss impact before they invest and write it into the investment documents. There's usually a few metrics that are core to their operations that we can measure and aggregate with our other companies. It isn't one single metric.<br>
                    Dan said we get a drastically different set of information from different companies. With one company, we get 30 pages. With some other companies, you get nothing until they're ready to raise capital.</p>
